There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > An app that lets you log in and view your saved anime lists, browse seasonal anime, and view suggested anime.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Anyone that likes anime and uses MAL!

## Summary ##
  > This app will primarily suggest new anime to users who log in. Users can easily save suggestions and view their lists as well as browse seasonal anime. Each anime will have associated genre, user rating, watched status, and overall rating on top of the basics.

## Problem ##
  > The official MAL site feels somewhat cluttered and difficult to find relevant suggestions for the average user or someone new to anime. I want to introduce the medium to people new to the genre in a simple but elegant way.

## Solution ##
  > Sorting lists or filtering by season will be more straightforward than the MAL site. I would like to implement multiple lists, filtering, viewing detailed anime info through a modal and adding shows to lists in the same scrollable view.

## Quote from You ##
  > Make it mainstream

## How to Get Started ##
  > All that you need to get started will be your login info from MAL (optional)

## Customer Quote ##
  > I love how easy it is to browse anime by categories and seasons!

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Check out the app and make sharing your anime simple again!
